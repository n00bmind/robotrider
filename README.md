# Features

· Totally isolated platform / renderer / game layers (only Windows platform & OpenGL for now)<br/>
· Hot code reloading (any change in the game layer code is immediately applied live)<br />
· Looped live code editing (press F1 and input will start recording, press F1 again and whatever was recorded will be played back in a loop.. you can still modify the code live as per the previous point!)<br />
· Live shaders recompilation (a la ShaderToy)<br/>
· Debug mode (tilde) & editor mode (Ctrl+tilde)<br/>
· Developer console with customizable commands<br />
· Infinite procedural world (WIP)<br/>
