FIX

AUDIO
- Win32: switch WASAPI to callback mode to reduce buffer size and improve latency.
  This implies creating a separate dedicated thread that just blits audio to the output.
  The buffer strategy wouldn't change, the game would check how much space is available and
  would produce the same amount of frames, and the blitter thread would simply blit said
  amount to the device.

VIDEO
- Hot code reloading for shaders! (a la ShaderToy)
- Force a stable framerate synced to a multiple of the monitor's refresh rate using wglSwapInterval (https://hero.handmade.network/episode/code/day241)
- Aspect ratio independece using black bars as needed

DEBUGGING
- Really dump game state to disk (asynchronously)
- Add a command line switch & ingame command to load a recorded input block from disk
