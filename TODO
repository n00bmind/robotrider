KNOWN ISSUES
- There's a fantastic megaglitch in the framerate every second or so! (actually the framerate is all over the place quite often)
- Hot code reloading seems broken


AUDIO
- Win32: switch WASAPI to callback mode to reduce buffer size and improve latency.
  This implies creating a separate dedicated thread that just blits audio to the output.
  The buffer strategy wouldn't change, the game would check how much space is available and
  would produce the same amount of frames, and the blitter thread would simply blit said
  amount to the device.

VIDEO
- Hot code reloading for shaders! (a la ShaderToy)
- Detect actual monitor refresh rate just in case we need to adjust wglSwapInterval
- Aspect ratio independece using black bars as needed

INPUT
- Find a way to calibrate different relative movement amounts from the different input methods

DEBUGGING
- Really dump game state to disk (asynchronously)
- Add a command line switch & ingame command to load a recorded input block from disk
- Simple static analysis:
  - Detect usage of 'internal' functions outside of the file where they're defined
