AUDIO
- Win32: switch WASAPI to callback mode to reduce buffer size and improve latency.
  This implies creating a separate dedicated thread that just blits audio to the output.
  The buffer strategy wouldn't change, the game would check how much space is available and
  would produce the same amount of frames, and the blitter thread would simply blit said
  amount to the device.
