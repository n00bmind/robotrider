// NOTE
//
///// HOW OUR UNIVERSE WILL WORK /////
//
// We will partition our universe in axis-aligned 'clusters', their length a (probably big) multiple of
// what we end up using for the hull chunks (so N chunks in every XYZ direction will form a cluster).
// At any given moment, one of this clusters will be the 'origin of the universe', meaning its center will be
// our universe's (0, 0, 0) coord, and all active entities' positions will be relative to this point.
// Everytime the player moves we will check whether he's moved to a new cluster, and if so, we'll mark the new
// cluster as the origin and offset all entities (including the player and the camera) as necessary.
// (Only 'hi' entity positions will be modified, 'lo' entity data always contains the absolute cluster they're in).
//
// We will maintain an apron around the origin where all entities will be active (something like a 3x3x3 cube probably),
// so when switching origins a certain number of clusters will have to be filled (built) if they were never visited
// before, or retrieved from the stored entities set and re-activated if we're returning to them.
// Our RNG will be totally deterministic, so any given cluster can (must) be filled in a deterministic way.
// (this implies getting rid of the always-connected pipes, at least in the way we do them now).
